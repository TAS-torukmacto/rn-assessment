# rn-assessment


In order to start, please fork this repo. `Scheduler.js` and `Solutions.txt` are the only files that needs to be modified in order to complete this assessment. Please provide the solutions to `1` and `2` by modifying `Solutions.txt` and use `Scheduler.js` for question `3`. <br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you have completed these tasks, in order to submit your work please create a pull request to the branch a3 for a review.


1. Write a function that spawns 2 child node processes that send back "Hello world" after x milliseconds, the delay should be defined by an argument (e.g. `node child_process 100`). The function should return a promise that resolves with the results of all child processes.


2. Write a javascript function that takes in 2 two arguments: date('2019-10-10') as the first and time('13:15:00') as the second. The function should compare it to the current time and reliably return 'true' if the datetime provided has already past or 'false' otherwise. Feel free to use any js date libraries.


3. The file `Scheduler.js` is developed alongside expo. In order to complete this, you will need a development tool setup to run react-native app either `expo` or `Vanilla React Native`.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The purpose of the `Scheduler` component is to display a list of activities scheduled over a week with an additional feature that allows user to move an activity to a different day. At the moment, the component just displays the activites for each day. Please make the necessary modifications to the file in order to meet the following acceptance criteria:<br><br>
* At the moment, any activity 'onLongPressed' displays a Modal at the bottom of the screen. The purpose of the modal is to allow users to choose a different day to move the selected activity to. The modal needs to display all 5 days 'Mon-Fri'.<br>

* When an activity is selected, the day it belongs to should be highlighted on the modal by default with a green background. 
* When an alternative day is selected, it should be indicated with a green background and grey background for all unselected days.<br>
* The `move` button should be disabled until an alternative day is selected and the `cancel` button when pressed should reset the modal state and hide it.<br>
* When the `move` button is pressed, the activity should be removed from its current day and moved to the selected day. The modal should be reset and hidden on finish.
